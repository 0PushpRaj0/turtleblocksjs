TurtleBlocks JS
===============

Turtle Blocks Javascript is an activity with a
Logo-inspired graphical "turtle" that draws colorful art based on
snap-together visual programming elements. Its "low floor" provides an
easy entry point for beginners. It also has "high ceiling"
programming, graphics, mathematics, and Computer Science features
which will challenge the more adventurous student.

> Note: Turtle Blocks JS closely parallels the Python version of Turtle
> Blocks, the version included in the Sugar distribution. Sugar users
> probably want to use Turtle Blocks rather than Turtle Blocks JS.

Using Turtle Art JS
-------------------

Turtle Blocks Javascript is designed to run in a browser. Most of the
development has been done in Chrome, but it should also work in
Firefox. You can run it directly from index.html, from a [server
maintained by Sugar Labs](http://turtle.sugarlabs.org), from the
[github
repo](http://rawgit.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/index.html),
or by setting up a [local
server](https://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/blob/master/server.md).

Once you've launched it in your browser, start by clicking on (or
dragging) blocks from the Turtle palette. Use multiple blocks to
create drawings; as the turtle moves under your control, colorful
lines are drawn.

You add blocks to your program by clicking on or dragging them from
the palette to the main area. You can delete a block by dragging it
back onto the palette. Click anywhere on a "stack" of blocks to start
executing that stack or by clicking in the Rabbit (fast) or Turtle
(slow) on the Main Toolbar.
